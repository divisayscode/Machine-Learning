##  Overview
This repository contains solutions to my **Machine Learning coursework assignments**.  
It covers two main parts:  

- **Assignment 1:** NumPy Fundamentals (arrays, matrices, statistics, linear algebra, image-to-array).  
- **Assignment 2:** Data preprocessing and similarity analysis on the **Adventure Works Customer Dataset**.

## üìù Assignment 1: NumPy Basics
### üîπ Topics Covered
- Array manipulations (reverse, flatten, compare).  
- Frequency analysis & index extraction.  
- Matrix operations: sum (total, row-wise, column-wise).  
- Linear algebra: diagonal sum, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, inverse, determinant.  
- Matrix multiplication & covariance.  
- Inner, outer, and Cartesian products.  
- Math & statistics: absolute, percentiles, mean, median, std. deviation.  
- Floor, ceiling, truncation, rounding.  
- Searching & sorting: smallest/largest elements, sorted indices.  
- Filtering integers vs floats.  
- Image-to-array conversion (RGB & Grayscale).

## üìù Assignment 2: Adventure Works Customer Data
###  Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle ‚Äì Adventure Works Cycles Customer Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jahias/microsoft-adventure-works-cycles-customer-data)  
- Size: ~18,000 rows  
- Contains demographics and attributes of past and potential bike customers.  

### üîπ Tasks
#### Part I: Feature Selection
- Chose relevant attributes influencing bike purchases.  
- Classified features as Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, or Ratio.  
- Created a new DataFrame with selected attributes.  

#### Part II: Data Preprocessing & Transformation
- Handling missing values.  
- Normalization & Standardization.  
- Discretization (binning) of continuous features.  
- One-Hot Encoding for categorical attributes.  

#### Part III: Proximity & Correlation Analysis
- Applied similarity measures:  
  -  Simple Matching  
  -  Jaccard Similarity  
  -  Cosine Similarity  
- Correlation analysis between **Commute Distance** and **Yearly Income**.
