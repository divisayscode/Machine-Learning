📘 Machine Learning Assignments – NumPy & Adventure Works Dataset
📌 Overview

This repository contains solutions to my Machine Learning coursework assignments.
It covers two main parts:

Assignment 1 – NumPy Fundamentals

Practice with NumPy arrays, matrices, statistics, linear algebra, and basic image handling.

Assignment 2 – Adventure Works Customer Data

Data preprocessing, transformation, and similarity analysis for predicting potential bike buyers.

📝 Assignment 1: NumPy Basics
Topics Covered

Array manipulation (reverse, flatten, compare arrays).

Frequency analysis and index extraction.

Matrix operations: sum, row-wise/column-wise aggregation.

Linear algebra: diagonal sum, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, inverse, determinant.

Matrix multiplication and covariance.

Vector operations: inner, outer, Cartesian products.

Mathematical and statistical functions: absolute, percentiles, mean, median, standard deviation.

Floor, ceiling, truncation, rounding.

Searching and sorting: smallest/largest elements, sorted indices.

Filtering integer vs float elements.

Image-to-array conversion (RGB & Grayscale).

📝 Assignment 2: Adventure Works Customer Data
Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Adventure Works Cycles Customer Data

~18,000 rows of customer demographic and purchase-related attributes.
