# Assignment 1: NumPy & Data Preprocessing

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to practice Python and NumPy operations for array manipulation, matrix computations, statistical analysis, and basic preprocessing. These tasks build the foundation for later machine learning assignments.

## Tasks

### Q1: Basic NumPy Array Operations
- Reverse a NumPy array.  
- Flatten a 2D array using two different methods.  
- Compare two arrays for equality.  
- Find the most frequent value(s) and their indices in arrays.  
- Perform matrix operations:
  - Sum of all elements, row-wise, and column-wise.  
  - Sum of diagonal elements.  
  - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  
  - Inverse and determinant of a matrix.  
- Multiply matrices and compute covariance.  
- Compute inner, outer, and cartesian products of matrices.  

### Q2: NumPy Mathematics & Statistics
- Element-wise absolute value.  
- Calculate percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th) for flattened array, rows, and columns.  
- Compute mean, median, and standard deviation (overall, row-wise, column-wise).  
- Floor, ceiling, truncated, and rounded values of an array.  

### Q3: Searching & Sorting
- Sort an array and get indices of sorted elements.  
- Find smallest and largest elements.  
- Extract integer and float elements separately from an array.  

### Q4: Image to Array Conversion
- Write a function `img_to_array(path)` that:  
  - Reads an image (RGB or grayscale).  
  - Saves it as a text file locally.  
- Load the saved file back into Jupyter Notebook.
